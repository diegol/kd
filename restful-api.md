- Hateos:  Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State

The principle is that a client interacts with a network application entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers. 

A REST client needs no prior knowledge about how to interact with any particular application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia. By contrast, in some service-oriented architectures (SOA), clients and servers interact through a fixed interface shared through documentation or an interface description language (IDL).

The HATEOAS constraint decouples client and server in a way that allows the server functionality to evolve independently.
